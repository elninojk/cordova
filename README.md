Cordova Samples

Platform to build mobile apps using html,js and css.
Basically we will be creating a web app which has access to native device functionalities.

So cordova offers a connection/link between webapp and actual device.

Course contents:
cordova plugins/api's and examples of using them.

Pre requisite:
HTML,CSS,JS , anyway not mandatory

Why cordova:
I would say Rapid development, yes very very fast. 

Limitations:
Slower than native
Not all api plugins are available
Not suitable for large apps(if lots of data involved)
